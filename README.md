What is DWM?
Concept drifts occurring in data streams will jeopardize the accuracy and stability of the online learning process. If the data stream is imbalanced, it will be even more challenging to detect and cure the concept drift. In the literature, these two problems have been intensively addressed separately, but have yet to be well studied when they occur together. [Provided research paper.]
